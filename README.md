## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution

Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Solution:

We propose building a Digital Biosecurity Farm Management Portal designed specifically for pig and poultry farmers. The platform will offer:

Smart Risk Assessment – Farmers answer a few questions, and the system generates a personalized biosecurity score and checklist.

Interactive Learning Zone – Simple videos, voice-based instructions, quizzes, AR-based demonstrations for hygiene and waste management.

Compliance Tracker – Daily logs, photo uploads, vaccination reminders, and progress toward government-approved disease-free compartment standards.

Real-Time Alerts – Disease outbreak alerts, weather-based disease prediction, and warnings about biosecurity breaches.

Farmer–Vet Network – Built-in chat, video call, and emergency reporting system.

Multilingual Access – Hindi, English, and major regional languages.

Offline Mode – Works even with low network conditions common in rural areas.

How It Addresses the Problem:

Gives farmers easy access to critical biosecurity knowledge

Removes the need for physical training by offering digital learning

Helps maintain records digitally, which improves compliance

Alerts prevent disease spread early

Builds a communication bridge between farmers and vets

Supports government monitoring and decision-making

Innovation and Uniqueness:

AI-powered risk assessment tailored to each farm

Voice-assisted navigation for non-literate users

AR-based training modules for practical demonstrations

Disease prediction models using weather + historical data

All-in-one platform combining alerts, training, compliance, and collaboration

## Technical Approach

Technologies to Be Used:

Frontend: ReactJS / Flutter (for mobile-first design)

Backend: Node.js / Django

Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase

AI/ML Tools: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch

Mapping & Alerts: Google Maps API, OpenWeather API

Security: Role-based access + encrypted health records

Cloud: AWS / Azure
## Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility Analysis:

Mobile phones are widely available → high adoption

Simple UI ensures even non-tech farmers can use it

Uses cloud storage → scalable across India

Matches government digital livestock missions

Potential Challenges and Risks:

Low digital literacy in rural areas

Poor internet connectivity

Hesitation from elderly farmers

Ensuring real-time data accuracy

Strategies to Overcome Challenges:

Voice instructions + icons-based UI

Offline mode for low network areas

On-ground training workshops

Auto-verification using photos/GPS

Incentives like digital badges for compliance
## Impact and Benefits
Impact on Target Audience

Farmers get practical tools to protect their animals

Vets get better data to diagnose problems early

Government gets clean data for disease surveillance

Benefits
Social:

Safer livestock → more stable rural livelihoods

Better farmer awareness

Economic:

Reduced disease losses

More productivity and profits

Environmental:

Better waste management

Lower chance of outbreaks spreading in the environment
